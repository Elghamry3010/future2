            appropriate
            content for a<br>
            particular audience, you can think about the structure of a paragraph in greater detail. Composing an<br>
            effective paragraph requires a method similar to building a house. You may have the finest content, or<br>
            materials, but if you do not arrange them in the correct order, then the final product will not hold
            together very well.<br>

            A strong paragraph contains three distinct components:

            Topic sentence. The topic sentence is the main idea of the paragraph.<br>
            Body. The body is composed of the supporting sentences that develop the main point.
            Conclusion. The conclusion<br> is the final sentence that summarizes the main point.</p>
